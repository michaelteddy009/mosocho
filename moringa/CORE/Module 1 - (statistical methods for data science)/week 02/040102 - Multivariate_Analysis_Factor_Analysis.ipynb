It helps in data interpretations by reducing the number of variables. It extracts maximum common variance from all variables and puts them into a common score.\n",

    "There are broadly two kinds of factor analysis, Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) and Confirmatory Factor Analysis  (CFA). EFA is where the variables that are highly correlated to each other are grouped. This group is known as a ‘factor’. Once this factor is created, it looks for another set of variables and groups them, making another factor. The number of factors that are to be created depends on the analyst and N (number of observed variables) number of factors can be created (i.e. one factor for each observed variable). This N number is decided based on a number of factors."

For example, we have ten variables where five of them seems to be related to education such as – How important formal studies are to you? Are you satisfied with the current method of examination etc while the other set of variables clearly seems to be dealing with sports such as How important sports are, how satisfied are you with the current situation of sports training? etc. Here we can easily guess that there seems to be two latent variables, however, to prove this statistically, we require to perform hypothesis testing and this is where CFA helps."
