    "With the availability of high performance CPUs and GPUs, it is pretty much possible to solve every regression, classification, clustering and other related problems using machine learning and deep learning models. However, there are still various factors that cause performance bottlenecks while developing such models. Large number of features in the dataset is one of the factors that affect both the training time as well as accuracy of machine learning models. You have different options to deal with huge number of features in a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Try to train the models on original number of features, which take days or weeks if the number of features is too high.\n",
    "* Reduce the number of variables by merging correlated variables.\n",
    "* Extract the most important features from the dataset that are responsible for maximum variance in the output. Different statistical techniques are used for this purpose e.g. linear discriminant analysis, factor analysis, and principal component analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Principal component analysis, or PCA, is a statistical technique to convert high dimensional data to low dimensional data by selecting the most important features that capture maximum information about the dataset. The features are selected on the basis of variance that they cause in the output. The feature that causes highest variance is the first principal component. The feature that is responsible for second highest variance is considered the second principal component, and so on. It is important to mention that principal components do not have any correlation with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages of PCA**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main advantages of dimensionality reduction with PCA.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The training time of the algorithms reduces significantly with less number of features.\n",
    "* It is not always possible to analyze data in high dimensions. For instance if there are 100 features in a dataset. Total number of scatter plots required to visualize the data would be 100(100-1)2 = 4950. Practically it is not possible to analyze data this way.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Normalization of Features**\n",
    "\n",
    "It is imperative to mention that a feature set must be normalized before applying PCA. For instance if a feature set has data expressed in units of Kilograms, Light years, or Millions, the variance scale is huge in the training set. If PCA is applied on such a feature set, the resultant loadings for features with high variance will also be large. Hence, principal components will be biased towards features with high variance, leading to false results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the last point to remember before we start coding is that PCA is a statistical technique and can only be applied to numeric data. Therefore, categorical features are required to be converted into numerical features before PCA can be applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's now implement PCA with the help of Python's Scikit-Learn library. We will follow the classic machine learning pipeline where we will first import libraries and dataset, perform exploratory data analysis and preprocessing, and finally train our models, make predictions and evaluate accuracies. The only additional step will be to perform PCA to find out optimal number of features before we train our models. These steps have been implemented as follows:"

A general rule of thumb is to take number of principal of principal components that contribute to significant variance and ignore those with diminishing variance returns. A good way is to plot the variance against principal components and ignore the principal components with diminishing values as shown in the following graph:"
