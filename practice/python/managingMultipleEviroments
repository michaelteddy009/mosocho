NB: This topic wasn't well understood But the Idea has been noted down here

Conda is similar to pip but more things can get done simply using conda. 

In projects we make a directory named my_project. This is done from the main page projects.

We first create an enviroment with the packages we would like it to contain. "conda create --name my_project_env flask sqlachemy pandas numpy". We can add and remove the packages as we wish depending by our project requirements.

 We can export the packages installed in this envroment like this "conda env export > enviroment.yaml"
 
 Having made this .yaml file someone else can grab this enviroment and make the same with just one command.
"conda env create -f enviroment.yaml" to create the same enviroment as the file.
 
We can navigate to our enviroment and create two directories where we are going to place our scripts. for example C:/anaconda3/envs/my_projects can be an enviroment where we can can create our enviroment variables

we make these two directories "mkdir -p etc/conda/activate.d" and the other as "mkdir -p etc/conda/deactivate.d".

We now create a file "touch etc/conda/activate.d/env_vars.sh" and "touch etc/conda/deactivate.d/env_vars.sh".we now need to create variables to activate and deactivate.

example is in the activation file we can create a variable like this "#!/bin/sh  => this is the first line to know this is a bash file"
next line "export DATABASE_URI="postgresql://user:pass@db_server:5432/testdb"".
Meaning when we activate this enviroment we then have this database property set

in the deactivate file we can specify file type in the first line list above then "unset DATABASE_URL".
