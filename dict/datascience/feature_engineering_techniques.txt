=> Below is a list of techniques to consider while feature engineering
	- Handling missing values.
	- Handling outliers which can be achieved using standard deviation or percentiles
	- Bin for both categorical and numeric data but note that by this you sacrifice info and you make your data more regularized.
	- Log transform to reflect the magnitudal difference. Data you perform log transform on should be positive.
	- Encoding categorical variables
	- Categorical column grouping where we can make use of pivot tables
	- Feature splitting
	- Scaling which we can either use normalization or standardization. not that normalization is sensitive to outliers
	- Extracting date column using the following ways for easier understanding by the machine learnin algorithm
		* Extract the parts of the date into different columns year, month, day, etc
		* Extract the time period between the current date and columns in terms of years, months, days, etc
		* Extract some specific features from the date like weekday, weekend, holiday
