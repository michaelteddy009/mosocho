This mini-programme is designed to read a file containg modules  obtained 
from running "pip freeze >> filename". Running this command saves the modules
with their version number. To make this file flexible we convert it to a form
without the versions using version_remover.py. On running this file another one
gets created which can be used to create bath download. The file created is
called cleaned_modules.txt
